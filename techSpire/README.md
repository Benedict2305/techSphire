TechSpire 

A simple tech landing page project

Hi! 👋
Welcome to TechSpire, a small landing page project I built to practice and improve my front-end development skills. The goal of this project was to create a clean and modern tech-style website while keeping the code simple and easy to understand.

This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only, without any frameworks. I wanted to focus on the basics and learn how things work under the hood.

About the Project

TechSpire is a single-page landing website designed to look professional but still simple. I paid attention to layout, responsiveness, and small interactive details to make the page feel more complete and user-friendly.

This project helped me practice structuring a page, styling components, and adding basic interactivity with JavaScript.

Features

Responsive Design
The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, including mobile phones and tablets.

Dark Mode Toggle
Users can switch between light and dark mode using a button. The selected theme is saved so it stays the same when the page is reopened.

Glass-Style Header
The header uses a glassmorphism effect to give the page a modern look.

Basic Interactions
Simple hover effects and transitions were added to buttons and navigation items.

How to Run the Project

No setup is needed.
